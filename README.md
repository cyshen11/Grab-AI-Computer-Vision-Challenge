# Grab-AI-Computer-Vision-Challenge

Grab AI Computer Vision Challenge.ipynb shows how I clean, explore the data and train the model.
I am using ResNet34 model.

Model weight still training in progress. Below is current trained model weight with 46% validation accuracy.

1. Grab AI Computer Vision Challenge.ipynb shows how to import, clean data and create, train ResNet34 model.
2. resnet.py has the code for ResNet architecture.
3. Predict.py allows you to choose the directory of images and predict the car model make & model.
