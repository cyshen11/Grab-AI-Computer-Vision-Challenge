# Grab-AI-Computer-Vision-Challenge

I did not managed to finish the script for you to upload test dataset to validate the model.
Anyway, Grab AI Computer Vision Challenge.ipynb shows how I clean, explore the data and train the model.
I am using ResNet18 model.

Model weight still training in progress. Below is current trained model weight with 40% validation accuracy.
